== Rules ==

Create bubbles to fight the monsters that try to reach the end of the track.
Each time a bubble kills a monster, it gains mass and size.  This has several
impacts:

* Massive bubbles will attract other bubbles
* Large bubbles have a stronger attack
* Since the splash radius of their attacks is equal to their size, large
  bubbles will hit more monsters with each attack.
* When you loose all your lives, large bubbles will pop and give you lives
  in return
* Massive bubbles will attack slightly slower

You can paint each bubble with a color by adding or removing the primary colors:
Red, Green and Blue.  Each color endows the bubble with certain properties, as
described in the next section.


== Colors ==

* Red color increases the damage of the bubble.
* Green color increases the range.
* Blue color adds a freeze effect to every shot which slows monsters
  permanently, down to a minimum of 50% of their original speed.

You can mix two colors and leave out the third color for a bonus effect:

* Yellow (red + green) increases the attack speed of the bubble
* Cyan (green + blue) adds an armor damaging effect to each shot, which reduces
  the armor of the monster by a given amount.
* Purple (blue + red) adds a supportive effect that increases the damage of
  each bubble in the range.

Note that a yellow bubble will lose yellowness if you add blue, so you can't
have one bubble with all the bonuses.

There are some bonus effects which you get for specific color mixtures:
* If your secondary colors (yellow, cyan, purple) are all zero, you get a
  purity bonus of +2 attacks per second.
* If your primary colors (red, green, blue) are all zero, you get a black hole
  bonus of 100% armor penetration.


== Monsters ==

Monsters gain in strength after each level.  This means that they get faster,
gain more hit points and get stronger armor.  Every three levels, a tough kind
of monster will appear which has twice the armor rating but half the hit points.

The score that you get for killing a monster is equal to its level.
